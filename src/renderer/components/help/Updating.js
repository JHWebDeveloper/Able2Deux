		<p>Everytime you open Able2, the software will check for updates. If an update is found, a window showing you the download progress will display. Once complete Able2 will close and install the update.</p>
		<p>Should there be an error during the update process, a retry option will appear. It may take a while to appear.</p>
		<p>Currently users are prevented from using Able2 during an update and updates cannot be skipped. This caveat is intentional and will be in place for as long as Able2 remains a freely distributed and managed software.</p>
